I've wanted to start up a new blog for a while now. My old one was with [Wordpress.com](http://pradnelluru.wordpress.com/). I used to update it fairly frequently, but as I got busier in college, I found less time to do so. 

Rather than continue on the same blog, I decided to start another one. I wanted to focus the content a little more; the old one was all over the place. I haven't decided how much, if any, of the old posts I'm going to bring over to this one.

I'm also glad to be moving away from Wordpress.com. It felt like all my content was stuck some place. It limited greatly what I could do with my work.

A static site generator seemed like the best choice. I've tried [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), [nanoc](http://nanoc.stoneship.org/), and [jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) before settling on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It's very popular, quite simple, and has a good community around it. I don't want the software I rely on to be someone's abandoned side project.

Jekyll is essentially a program that takes some templates and text files and generates the entire website for you. The entire site ends up being just a bunch of html files that you can serve from anywhere. The site becomes extremely fast (content doesn't need to be regenerated every time) and secure as a result (no database to hack into). I end up knowing exactly how my website works and have full control over my content. To add posts, I simply have to add a text file written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

One downside is that you can't run code dynamically on the server, which you usually need to let people comment on posts. To solve the problem, I'm using Disqus, which lets me outsource my entire commenting system to people who know what they're doing. In the end, I've got a very simple blog with exactly the features I want.

The entire blog is being hosted on Github Pages, so the hosting is completely free. To round it all off, I bought my first domain ever (pradnelluru.com) and set it to point to this site.

I expect much of the site to evolve as my views change. I can only guarantee that the post urls will work.
